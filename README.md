### Overview
Using historical yellow taxi data this data analyst project aims to find insights into most profitable times for taxi drivers to operate by analyzing fare data by hour and day of the week. The project involves data cleaning, trend analysis, and the development of a supervised machine learning model to predict average profits using historical data.

### Data Sources
The dataset I reference for this project is from NYC Open Data it contains historical data pretaining to yellow taxi cab trips. The origional datase contains 38,310,226 data entries each with 19 feature columns. The historical data ranges from 2001 to 2023 and the dataset was made public in 2024. However I reduced the dataset to features relevant to the goal of the project as follows:
-Pickup datetime
-Dropoff datetime
-Fare amount
-Tip amount
-Trip distance
-Total amount

### Tools
- Excel: initial exploration, manual cleaning, calculate and store new data 
- Python: (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, TensorFlow) â€“ data wrangling, model building, and visualization
- PowerBI: Create dashboard and clean reports
